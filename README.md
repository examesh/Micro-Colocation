## About

There are some colocations available for Single Board Computers like the famous Raspberry Pi. However, we wanted to create a special one. Due to our long experience with decentralized data centers we can offer you a sunny place at the green edge:

We host your mini computer in one of our small decentralized edge colocations inside a wind turbine or a solar park. The best part: The locations are operated 24/7 with green energy. So your device is not only truly decentralized, but also climate-neutral in operation.


## Colocation

The locations are currently spread all over Germany. In the future, further locations are to follow throughout the EU.
Best of all, EU locations mean EU privacy.


## Features

✅ [Flexible rack space](https://micro-colocation.com/docs/what-devices-can-i-operate-in-the-colocation/)
✅ Unlimited traffic
✅ Public IPv6 address
✅ Remote Power On/Off
✅ Remote Console Access
✅ No setup fee

✅ Location Germany


## Edge Data Center

Your Raspberry Pi or any other Single Board Computer, with or without additional periphery such as an additional hard drive, will be installed in our self-developed rack.

## Booking

[Click on Order](https://micro-colocation.com/product/colocation/) and you will enter the simple but flexible one-page colocation setup. After configuration, fill in your address and select a payment method.


## Configure

After the colocation is booked, you will be automatically redirected to the administration page. There you will find all the necessary information to prepare your colocation device(s).



## Send

After you have read all the instructions on the administration page and finished configuring your Raspberry Pi, Single Board Computer oder other devices, you can prepare the package. For the shipping label, please note the following: Be sure to add as c/o the ID that is displayed on the administration page. It can look like this: 4212:938332. It is important that this ID is on the label, otherwise the package cannot be correctly and automatically assigned to your booking at the head office.



## Deployment

After receiving your package, it usually takes 24-48 hours to install it in the edge data center. Once your device is installed, you will receive an email notification from us.
