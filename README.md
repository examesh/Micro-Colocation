Your [Mico Colocation](https://micro-colocation.com) Service Within Our Green Edge Data Centers.

## About

There are some colocations available for Single Board Computers like the famous Raspberry Pi. However, we wanted to create a special one. Due to our long experience with decentralized data centers we can offer you a sunny place at the green edge:

We host your mini computer in one of our small decentralized edge colocations inside a wind turbine or a solar park. The best part: The locations are operated 24/7 with green energy. So your device is not only truly decentralized, but also climate-neutral in operation.


## Colocation

The locations are currently spread all over Germany. In the future, further locations are to follow throughout the EU.
Best of all, EU locations mean EU privacy.


## Edge Data Center

Your Raspberry Pi or any other Single Board Computer, with or without additional periphery such as an additional hard drive, will be installed in our self-developed rack.
